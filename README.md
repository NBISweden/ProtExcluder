# ProtExcluder

This is a modified version of ProtExcluder downloaded from its original site at
http://www.hrt.msu.edu/uploads/535/78637/ProtExcluder1.2.tar.gz

Two of the scripts, namely `ProtExcluder.npl` and `mspesl-sfetch.npl` are
modified so that the paths for HMMER and this package do not need to be changed
after conda install. 

For any potential questions regarding running the software, please refer to the
original webpage at
